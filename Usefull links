National Vulnerability Database
https://nvd.nist.gov/

The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). 
This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. 
The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, product names, and impact metrics.

CVE™ Program
https://www.cve.org/About/Overview

The mission of the CVE™ Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 
There is one CVE Record for each vulnerability in the catalog. 
The vulnerabilities are discovered then assigned and published by organizations from around the world that have partnered with the CVE Program. 
Partners publish CVE Records to communicate consistent descriptions of vulnerabilities. 
Information technology and cybersecurity professionals use CVE Records to ensure they are discussing the same issue, and to coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address the vulnerabilities.
